In the spirit that side projects should be silly and fun, I have created a react/redux microwave. Set a time and watch it glow!

Improvements to be made are:
  - More code cleanup and refactoring
  - Add open/close functionality
  - Sounds
  - Make it prettier

to run:
    *from the cod directory
    npm install
    npm run start
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
